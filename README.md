# OpenAPI Data Parser

This program is made to turn easy the task of generate input and output models
for C# or other languages from the JSON data of the OpenAPI 3.0.1.

This project isn't nothing serious or really efficient, it's just a tool that
my boss requested because of the bad results of the JSON-to-code pasting of
C# with this ammount of data.

Still being pretty raw, it's a well structured base.

The program can easilly turn in C# easy plugable classes schemes and services.
In the future, is planned to be added some writers for javascript too, also an
easy plug-in system do add custom writers.

The project is free and allowed to fork, change and distribute.
The project accepts pull requests.


## Random observations:

Some comments maybe are in portuguese (pt-BR). I will change it sometime when i have
time. Fell free to change it to English and send a pull request if you want (but at
least do somethong more, so much effort for translating comments, really? lol)
